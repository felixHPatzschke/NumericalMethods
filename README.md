A collection of utilities for Numerical Methods
=======================================

For the course "Numerical Methods", I am every now and then required to write a bit of code. I thought it might be a good idea, to make that code available.

Contents:
------
* Data types like Vectors, Complex Numbers
* Algorithms for numerically finding a function's roots
* Function interpolation, approximation
* Numerical differentiation and integration
* ? *Solution methods for differential equations* ?

I will mostly only test my code with MSVC, and from my experience that leaves many errors that will appear, when you try it with GCC. And over all it will mostly be quite hacky stuff anyway.
